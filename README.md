### **1. Title: Project Walley - Secure Digital ID Storage for Kids**

### **2. Introduction/Vision**
Project Walley is a revolutionary iOS application designed to provide parents with a secure and convenient way to store digital clones of their children's important identification cards. In an increasingly digital world, physical IDs (like school IDs, library cards, bus passes, etc.) are prone to being lost, damaged, or forgotten. Walley leverages Near Field Communication (NFC) and RFID technology to create encrypted, non-fungible digital copies of these cards, storing them securely on a parent's iPhone. This ensures that children always have access to their essential IDs when needed, providing peace of mind for parents and a seamless experience for kids.

### **3. Target Audience**
*   Parents/Guardians of children aged 5-17.
*   Tech-savvy families who are comfortable using digital solutions.
*   Schools and institutions looking to partner with a digital ID solution.

### **4. User Personas**
*   **The Busy Mom (Sarah, 38):** Has two school-aged children. Juggles work, school runs, and after-school activities. Needs a reliable way to ensure her kids don't lose their bus passes or school lunch cards.
*   **The Tech-Dad (Mark, 42):** Loves gadgets and new technology. Wants a secure and futuristic way to manage his family's digital life. Concerned about the security of his children's data.
*   **The Independent Teen (Alex, 15):** Responsible but sometimes forgetful. Wants a cool and easy way to carry their student ID and library card without a bulky wallet.

### **5. User Stories/Features**
*   **As a parent, I want to easily clone my child's ID card using my iPhone's NFC reader so that I can have a digital backup.**
    *   **Feature:** Simple, guided NFC/RFID card scanning process.
*   **As a parent, I want to store multiple ID cards for each of my children in a single, organized app.**
    *   **Feature:** Multi-child profiles and a categorized card wallet.
*   **As a parent, I want to be sure that my children's data is secure and cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals.**
    *   **Feature:** End-to-end encryption, biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID), and secure enclave storage.
*   **As a parent, I want to be able to share a temporary or restricted version of an ID with my child's other parent or a trusted guardian.**
    *   **Feature:** Secure sharing with time-based access controls.
*   **As a child/teen, I want to be able to quickly access and display my ID on my own device (or my parent's device) when needed.**
    *   **Feature:** A simplified "kid's view" with easy access to relevant IDs.
*   **As a school administrator, I want to be able to verify the authenticity of a digital ID presented by a student.**
    *   **Feature:** A verification mechanism for partner institutions (e.g., a QR code or a companion verification app).

### **6. Functional Requirements**
*   **Card Cloning:**
    *   The app must be able to read and clone a variety of low-frequency and high-frequency RFID/NFC cards.
    *   The cloning process should be user-friendly, with clear on-screen instructions.
    *   The app should create a non-fungible, encrypted digital representation of the card.
*   **Wallet Management:**
    *   Users can create profiles for multiple children.
    *   Users can add, name, and categorize cloned cards.
    *   Users can add a photo of the physical card for visual reference.
*   **Security:**
    *   All data must be stored with end-to-end encryption.
    *   App access must be protected by Face ID or Touch ID.
    *   Digital card data should be stored in the iPhone's Secure Enclave for maximum protection.
*   **ID Presentation:**
    *   The app will present a digital version of the card, including a scannable barcode or QR code if applicable.
    *   For NFC-enabled terminals, the app will be able to emulate the original card's signal.
*   **Sharing:**
    *   Parents can share specific cards with other trusted adults via AirDrop or a secure link.
    *   Shared access can be revoked at any time.

### **7. Non-Functional Requirements**
*   **Performance:** The app should be fast and responsive, with card cloning taking no more than a few seconds.
*   **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for non-technical users.
*   **Reliability:** The app must be stable and function correctly every time an ID is needed.
*   **Compatibility:** The app must be compatible with the latest version of iOS and a range of iPhone models with NFC capabilities.
*   **Privacy:** The app will have a clear privacy policy and will not collect or sell user data.

### **8. Assumptions and Dependencies**
*   Users will have an iPhone with NFC capabilities.
*   The ID cards to be cloned will be of a compatible RFID/NFC standard.
*   Apple's Core NFC framework will provide the necessary APIs for card reading and emulation.

### **9. Success Metrics**
*   Number of app downloads and active users.
*   Number of cards successfully cloned and stored.
*   User satisfaction ratings and reviews in the App Store.
*   Partnerships with schools or other institutions.

### **10. Future Considerations**
*   **Android Version:** Develop a version of the app for Android devices.
*   **Wearable Integration:** Allow users to access and display IDs from an Apple Watch.
*   **Family Sharing:** Deeper integration with Apple's Family Sharing for seamless setup and management.
*   **Institutional Partnerships:** Develop a dedicated platform for schools and other organizations to issue and manage digital IDs directly through Walley.
